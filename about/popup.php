                extremely convenient exchange policy for your benefit that you can follow in 3
                easy steps!<br />
                <br />Step 1:<br />

                be sent in exchange. The courier will pick up the exchange item from your
                doorstep and bring it to us for review. Once we've reviewed the exchange
                item for quality and hygiene we will let you know if your exchange has been

                sealed up properly for exchange to avoid damage and
                tampering on their way to the store. All exchange items will be inspected once
                we receive them before we can complete an exchange request. We try hard to accept all items returned to us to serve you better, but request
                that all returned items should pass our inspection for points mentioned above
                Item(s) can be exchanged for a different size, or an alternative product(s), subject to availability of stock. The exchange will be free of charge if the item

                accepted by shellin in an effort to reduce cost for the customer. However, any
                courier charge that exceeds this allowance of Rs.150 will be charged to
                the customer. <br /><br />Please note that all exchanges will take a period of 14 days in order to
                accommodate the courier return time, inspection time, product processing
                and courier delivery time. Your patience is highly appreciated<br /><br />
